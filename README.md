##### ABOUT STREAMS API:

The Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.

We can combine Streams with filter, sort, collect, map and more operations.
